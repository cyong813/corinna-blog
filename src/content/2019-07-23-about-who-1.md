Thanks for making it all the way out here in the Internet.

My name is Corinna, and I'm a programmer. Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, with a bachelors degree from NYU in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. I'm an American-born Chinese with Malaysian heritage (my parents were raised in Ipoh).

This blog is meant for me to write anything - my thoughts, wants, places I've been to, things I've learned along the way, vice versa. Thought it would be cool to put it all down on the Internet where  my thoughts can reach someone someday, or help someone I guess.

Hope to see you more often!
